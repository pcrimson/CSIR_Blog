Instructions
------------

1.Commit as often as possible with meaningful commit messages. We prefer seeing the actual progression of commits rather than everything appearing perfectly all at once. After creating the project, please commit it as the initial commit so that we can clearly differentiate where the Spring Initializr code ends and your code begins.
2. Create your own database tables, relationships for CRUD operations.
3. Simple business rule validation to be implemented.
4. Use applicable object-oriented concepts.
5. Write unit tests for each endpoint implemented and ensure tests cover both successful and failure scenarios.
6. The implementation of authentication is not required. You can hard-code the user identification if needed.
7. Please submit this within 2 days of receiving the assessment.
